# IAM Policy Simulation with NIST 800-53 Controls
> Simulated identity and access management scenarios focused on enforcing least privilege and aligning access policies with NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 standards.

## Project Duration
**Apr 2024 – May 2024**

## Tools & Technologies Used
- AWS IAM (simulated environment)
- Google Workspace Admin Console (simulated org structure)
- Forage Cybersecurity Virtual Experience (Tata Group)
- Excel / Google Sheets (for access reviews)
- NIST SP 800-53 rev.5, ISO/IEC 27001

## Project Overview
This project simulated access control reviews within a corporate IT environment. The goal was to evaluate user permissions, apply least privilege principles, and align access management policies with established cybersecurity frameworks (NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001).

## Key Features / Tasks Performed
- Audited user roles, group memberships, and elevated permissions across simulated cloud and on-prem systems.
- Identified policy violations and overprovisioned accounts based on job functions.
- Created IAM policy matrices with justification and remediation recommendations.
- Drafted documentation to align access policies with AC family of NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 A.9 standards.
- Presented findings in a mock audit review format.

## Results / What I Learned
- Strengthened understanding of RBAC and least privilege enforcement.
- Learned how to align IAM practices with compliance frameworks.
- Practiced translating technical policy assessments into audit-ready documentation.
- Gained awareness of real-world access control risks and remediation techniques.
